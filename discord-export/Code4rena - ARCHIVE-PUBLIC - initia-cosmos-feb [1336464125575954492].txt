Hi, we have only 2 weeks for this audit ? I ask because the previous audit was on 2.5 months, 2 weeks is very low no ?

I might agree with this, if there is a chance for sponsors to extend time even later.. the codebase still not small for such time. -)


[02/10/2025 20:36] yannouxone4all
Yeah, we suppose to need 7-9 days for just made understand the core feature a little deep

Hey, I see we only have two weeks for this audit, but the last one took 2.5 months. That’s a big difference, and two weeks might not be enough for a thorough review. Can we extend the deadline to ensure quality work?

@hoon what cosmos sdk version is used by the protocol


[02/11/2025 13:06] itsmetechjay
ℹ️ Hey all, I believe you are referring to the [Zellic audit report](https://github.com/Zellic/publications/blob/master/Initia%20-%20Zellic%20Audit%20Report.pdf).  This is C4's third Initia competitive audit. Each has covered a different scope.  

We don't have any planned extensions at this time.

this contest includes these repos?


[02/11/2025 13:42] itsmetechjay
It includes the 3 repos listed in the `Files in scope` section, correct.

so the linked module like OPinit module is considered out of scope?


[02/17/2025 20:13] itsmetechjay
where are you seeing it linked?


[02/17/2025 22:57] 0x04bytes
Inside the source code import statement. I mean in terms of module dependencies relationship.

hey, how to submit a finding!?


[02/18/2025 04:42] advikaadriti
just give it to me i will do it for you :10_10:

@beer-1 
Hi, I have some questions regarding executing functions of a published Move module.

When I run the following command, referenced from the Initia documentation(https://docs.initia.xyz/build-on-initia/vm-specific-tutorials/movevm/deploying-move-modules), I encounter an error:
```sh
> initiad tx move execute [addr] read_write write \
  --args "string:new_string" \
  --from [key-name] \
  --gas auto --gas-adjustment 1.5 --gas-prices 0.15uinit \
  --node [rpc-url]:[rpc-port] --chain-id [chain-id]
```
Error message: 
```
rpc error: code = Unknown desc = rpc error: code = Unknown desc = failed to execute message; message index: 0: VM error: status NUMBER_OF_ARGUMENTS_MISMATCH of type Verification [cosmos/cosmos-sdk@v0.50.11/baseapp/baseapp.go:1023] with gas used: '103075': unknown request
```
How can I properly execute a Move contract function?

Additional Information:
- The `read_write` module was deployed successfully. Running `initiad query move view [addr] read_write read` works as expected.
- However, executing functions does not work. This issue also occurs with the "Creating Move Coin" example, leading to the same error.
- It seems like I am unable to execute any Move modules.

Any guidance on this issue would be greatly appreciated!


[02/18/2025 14:21] beer__1
hmm can you send the command you used?


[02/18/2025 14:28] zsystm
@beer-1 Thanks for quick response.
```
initiad tx move execute 0xA5A86C9F4ADA16B0715C426C0CC9C2FFA298389E read_write write \
--args "string:new_string" \
--from testkey \
--gas auto --gas-adjustment 1.5 --gas-prices 0.15uinit \
--chain-id local
```


[02/18/2025 14:28] beer__1
seesm docs are out dated,  thanks for pointing can you try with
```
 --args '["string:new_string"]'
```

I'm struggling to run the `MiniWASM` minitia as a standalone chain. It immediately fails with an error from the wasm module with the error: "failed to load latest version: version of store wasm mismatch root store's version; expected 19 got 0; new stores should be added using StoreUpgrades"
Using the default list of commands to launch it, so:
```sh
export CHAIN_ID=minitia
minitiad init operator --chain-id $CHAIN_ID
minitiad keys add operator
minitiad genesis add-genesis-account operator 10000000000umin
minitiad genesis add-genesis-validator operator
minitiad start
```


[02/19/2025 15:51] beer__1
Can you do 

minitiad comet unsafe-reset-all


[02/19/2025 15:52] beer__1
Also can you try to just remove ~/.minitia ? If you had any other minitia up before


[02/19/2025 15:52] franfran5067
That worked! Thanks!
